          Why is clean code important? Clean code saves time. Clean code makes maintenance easier. Clean code makes things better for other developers who work with your code in the future.

            <li>You are responsible for the quality of your code.
You are responsible. Not your client. Not your boss. You don’t tell your doctor to skip washing their hands because it saves time. Standards and quality are important.</li>
            <li>Use meaningful names.
Variables shouldn’t be cryptic. If you do this, later in your editing session, and next week, next week and next year, you’ll know exactly what that variable is referring to.
3. Write code that expresses intent.</li>
            <li>Write code that expresses intent.
Things in your code should explain what they do in their names. For example, name methods in such a way that the method name explains what it does. Clean code reads like well-written prose.</li>
            <li>Comments are often lies waiting to happen.
While comments are important, code should speak for itself whenever possible. When commenting extensively, you now need to maintain the comments, as well as the code. So what? The reason this matters is that incorrect comments might take a future developer down the wrong path. Please note this does *not* say “never write comments.” Instead, expressive code requires less commenting and is cleaner.</li>
            <li>Leave your code better than you found it.
Not only should you write clean code, but also take a few minutes to clean up cruft when you find it. Following this mantra means that code can actually get cleaner and cleaner over time.</li>
            <li>Follow the single responsibility principle.
A clean piece of code does one thing, it does it well and it does it only. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Look for cohesiveness. If you are trying to do too many things in one class, it’s a problem.</li>
